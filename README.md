##Get started with development!

First download Meteor: https://www.meteor.com/

Then download Git (CLI): https://git-scm.com/ 

Once that is done, get the repository on your local machine and open your command line.

Navigate to "../app" and run "meteor". Go to localhost:3000 and you're set!

##How to use git!

(this will only work if you are a contributor)

Run the following commands if you are doing this for the first time.
`git remote add origin https://github.com/AkiraLaine/music-app.git`

After you have ran the command above, you will have to do these command each time you start coding.

`git pull origin master` to get the latest version of the website.

`git add FILES` to add all the files you have changed.

`git commit -m "MESSAGE"` to commit the changes you have made.

`git push origin master` to push your website to GitHub. Note: it is recommended to first run `git pull origin master` before you do this command.
