                <h1 class="questions">How can I add a song?</h1>
                <h2 class="answers">You can add a song if you are logged in, by clicking on the Add Song button under the video in the station you want to add your song in. That will open up a modal where you can search for a title in YouTube or SoundCloud, or you can paste a YouTube link into there and click the Search Song button. You can then edit some more information, like the artist and title. It's helpful for us if you fill those in so we don't have to research every song, but you are not required to.</h2>

                <h1 class="questions">Can I skip a song?</h1>
                <h2 class="answers">Yes, and no. You can vote on skipping a song. You can click the blue skip button. When the counter hits 3, the song will be skipped. Admins and mods can skip songs without needing to vote, but please do not ask us to skip songs.</h2>

                <h1 class="questions">I added a song but I can't find it in the Playlist, where is it?</h1>
                <h2 class="answers">When you request a song to be added to a playlist, an admin or moderator first needs to review, edit and then either accept or deny that song.</h2>

                <h1 class="questions">How do I use emoji's in chat?</h1>
                <h2 class="answers">In chat, you can see emoji's by typing the ':' in chat and then a keyword or some letters of an emoji. That opens a dropdown box from where you can choose emoji's to put in chat. You can also just type it manually. You can find the full list of emoji's at <a href="http://emoji.codes/" target="_blank">www.emoji.codes</a></h2>
