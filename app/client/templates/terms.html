        <p><b>C. License to Musare of Your User-Generated Content.</b> Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms (such as a contest official rules), which specifically govern the submission of your User-Generated Content, you hereby grant to Musare, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User-Generated Content (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same. Without limitation, the granted rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache, archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat, edit, adapt, publish in searchable format, and remove such User-Generated Content and combine same with other materials, and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any User-Generated Content for any purposes whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing products and/or services. You understand that in exercising such rights metadata, notices and content may be removed or altered, including copyright management information, and you consent thereto and represent and warrant you have all necessary authority to do so. In order to further effect the rights and license that you grant to Musare to your User-Generated Content, you also hereby grant to Musare, and agree to grant to Musare, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any User-Generated Content, without any obligation or remuneration to you. Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User-Generated Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.

You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section 5(C).</p>
        <p><b>D. Exclusive Right to Manage Our Site.</b> Musare may, but will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, post, store, maintain, accept, or otherwise make use of, any of your User-Generated Content, and Musare may, in its sole discretion, reject, delete, move, re-format, remove or refuse to post or otherwise make use of User-Generated Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party in connection with our operation of User-Generated Content venues in an appropriate manner. Without limitation, we may do so to address content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or to enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, including, without limitation, the content restrictions set forth below in Section 6. Such User-Generated Content submitted by you or others need not be maintained on the Site by us for any period of time and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, or otherwise use such User-Generated Content on the Site or elsewhere.</p>
        <p><b>E. Representations and Warranties Related to Your User-Generated Content.</b> Each time you submit any User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside and are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any User-Generated Content you submit, and that, as to that User-Generated Content, (a) you are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property and other rights to the User-Generated Content, or you have a lawful right to submit the User-Generated Content and grant Musare the rights to it that you are granting by these Terms and any Additional Terms, all without any Musare obligation to obtain consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability of Musare; (b) the User-Generated Content is accurate; (c) the User-Generated Content does not and, as to Musare’s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (d) the User-Generated Content will not violate these Terms (including the Rules) or any Additional Terms, or cause injury or harm to any person.</p>
        <p><b>F. Enforcement.</b> Musare has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User-Generated Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our rights to your User-Generated Content, including by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at Musare’s cost and expense, to which you hereby consent and irrevocably appoint Musare as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled with an interest).</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">6. Our Rules</h4>
        <p>We may, but are not obligated to, provide our users with the ability to post and receive messages from other Musare-listed users or allow you to participate in video or live chats with your friends or other users. If we do, you will not use the messaging system or your username to spam, defame, harass, or do anything we find to be objectionable (which is up to us), including, but not limited to, language that attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status and sexual orientation or gender identity. It is your responsibility to maintain proper etiquette, and we reserve the right to terminate the account for anyone who violates our policies. We also do not monitor any particular chat, but reserve the right to edit, modify, ban, or filter any User-Generated Content or username for any reason. If someone posts something that is offensive or objectionable please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you. We do not, however, assume any obligation to remove such User-Generated Content.</p>
        <p>You may share videos and music that is hosted on a third party website (i.e., Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.) but only if it does not conflict with their terms or any applicable law. You may not, however, share, post or otherwise communicate any content (video, audio, or text) that is unlawful, threatening, violent, pornographic, harassing, obscene, racist, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to determine what is objectionable at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above, you agree that you will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>* Infringe on anyone's intellectual property or other legal rights (i.e. invasion of privacy).</li>
            <li>* Hack, crack, phish, SQL inject, or otherwise compromise the security of our website or its servers.</li>
            <li>* Solicit business, spam, or otherwise use our service for commercial purposes unless expressly authorized by us.</li>
            <li>* Defraud or threaten any of our users through any method, whether it be through our website or through another method of communication.</li>
            <li>* Create more than one active user account, or create a new user account if we have previously banned, suspended, or otherwise terminated your first user account.</li>
            <li>* Harass anyone.</li>
            <li>* Impersonate anyone.</li>
            <li>* Do anything unlawful or bad (we define what is bad)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How we react to your violation of any of these Terms does not mean we will treat everyone the same. We may do anything from yell at you, temporarily suspend your account, ban you, or haul you into Court.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">7. Sharing Videos and Music</h4>
        <p>Musare may permit you to share videos and music with your friends. We may also allow you to use video or live chat to discuss the video or music as it is playing. Please note, however, that we do not host any User-Generated Content ourselves. Instead, you must use our platform to share your video or music from the third party video hosting website. You agree that you will be responsible for the User-Generated Content you upload, and that nothing you share will infringe on the rights of anyone. Furthermore, you warrant you have the ability to grant the right to share such User-Generated Content without any obligation to pay any royalties to any copyright owner. You will be responsible for the payment of any royalty and any associated damages, fees, fines or penalties, in the event we find out you have shared User-Generated Content in violation of another’s intellectual property rights.</p>
        <p>Not to sound like a broken record, but we have to make sure you understand that you will be responsible for any User-Generated Content that you upload, including the consequences of any infringement. By sharing any User-Generated Content you are, in essence, utilizing a third party license to distribute and share User-Generated Content. You may only do this if the Site from which you are linking has given you a license to share such User-Generated Content in the manner contemplated. If it does not, then you cannot share that User-Generated Content.</p>
        <p>For further clarity, you must only distribute videos or music that you are legally permitted to...meaning you cannot share videos or music that violates anyone’s third party intellectual property rights. For example, you must not share anything that the third party site would prohibit. In addition you will not modify, edit, disassemble, or create derivatives of anything that you do not own the rights to.</p>
        <p>Should you believe that your rights are being infringed on by, please note that we are not responsible for hosting it and it is the third party site which is serving the file, and until is removed from the third party site, it will still be available through their search engine. As such, copyright notices should be sent to both us and the third party site, and you should visit their terms for more information.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">8. DMCA Notices</h4>

        <h4 class="center-align">12. Indemnity</h4>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, partners, agents, and suppliers, and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, shareholders, partners, and agents, from any claim, action, demand, liability, judgment, or damage, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of the Site and/or your violation of these Terms, including, without limitation, the infringement by you in your User-Generated Content or any other user of your account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. We may, at our sole discretion, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. The assumption of such defense or control by us, however, shall not excuse any of your indemnity obligations.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">13. Choice of Law</h4>
        <p>We wish to make things as simple as possible in applying this Agreement to our users, and we can’t do that if a different jurisdiction’s law applies for each user who signs up based on where they live. Therefore, you agree that this Agreement is subject solely to and shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws applicable in the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">14. Dispute Resolution</h4>

        <h4 class="center-align">15. Waiver of Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief</h4>
        <p>IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER-GENERATED CONTENT, PRODUCT, SITE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY MUSARE (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER-GENERATED CONTENT) OR A LICENSOR OF MUSARE.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">16. Force Majeure</h4>
        <p>You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), any third party site being down, communication disruption, failure or shortage of infrastructure, zombie attacks, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">17. Cancellation of Service</h4>
        <p>You agree that we may cancel our service or the Site at any time, for any reason, without warning or compensation, even if we have been advised that it may result in a loss to you or any other party.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">18. Severability</h4>
        <p>In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unlawful or unenforceable provision being included in it.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">19. Update to Terms</h4>
        <p>These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the Site to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use). AS OUR SITE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SITE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SITE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you should review the posted terms of Site and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Site (at least prior to each transaction or submission). The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Site will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should frequently check the home page, your message account and the e-mail you associated with your account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice. You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Site and related services.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">20. Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement; Termination; Survival</h4>
        <p>Musare reserves the right, without any limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its Site security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any Additional Terms, (iii) investigate any information obtained by Musare in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with criminal laws, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Site, in whole or in part, or, except as may be expressly set forth in any Additional Terms, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party.
