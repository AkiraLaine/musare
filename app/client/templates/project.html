        <p class="flow-text">
            Musare is a modern, open source, collaborative music app where a user can go into any of our "stations" and
            listen to music simultaneously with other users in that "station".

        <p class="flow-text">
            Musare's end goal is to be a collaborative way of discovering new music. We are working hard to implement
            all the features that are necessary for this.

        <h4 class="thin">How can I help?</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
            There are essentially 3 main ways in which you can help us:
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you are a JavaScript developer, then we can use your help! Out project is open source and all the
                source code can be found on GitHub. We would love for you to create new features, add exciting
                content or just improve what already is on Musare. Also, if you see a bug or glitch on Musare, then
                create anew
                "issue" on GitHub and we will fix it as soon as possible. You can also have a try at fixing a
                bug that you may find!
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are not a developer but want some way of supporting us - you can donate to Musare. Any
                amount of donation is highly appreciated, and will help us maintain server costs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send us feedback! You're comments and/or suggestion are extermely valuable to us. In order to improve
                we need to know what you like, don't like or what you might want on the app.
